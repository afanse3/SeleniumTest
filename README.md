# UI Automation Selenium Java
 Learning about UI Automation using Selenium Java using saucedemo.com website

How to run
1. First you need to install Java SDK 19 version, dont' use SDK 20 because Selenium still (as of my commit) doesn't support it so it will give an error. Then install Intellij IDE.
2. Clone this repo
```
https://github.com/afanse3/UI-Automation-Selenium-Learning.git
```
3. Open this file using Intellij IDE.
4. Install depedencies in the maven pom.xml
5. Open src/test/java/Login.java (Login case) or src/test/java/Purchase.java (Purchase case)
6. Run with debugger using Intellij
